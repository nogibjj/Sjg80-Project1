# Sjg80-Continuous Integration using GitHub Actions of Python Data Science Project

This is an example project for Python using GitHub CodeSpaces

## DATASET
This data sets consists of 3 different types of irisesâ€™ (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) petal and sepal length, stored in a 150x4 numpy.ndarray
The rows being the samples and the columns being: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width.

## MATPLOTLIB
This code is performing data analysis and visualization on the Iris dataset using the Polars library for data manipulation and Pandas-like operations along with Matplotlib for creating visualizations.

## POLARS
This code reads the Iris dataset using Polars, defines functions for calculating descriptive statistics and creating boxplots, and then applies these functions to the 'petal.length' column of the dataset while also printing the descriptive statistics. Additionally, it saves the boxplot as an image file.

# JUPYTER NOTEBOOK

Statistics performed in Iris Notebook:

- Descriptive statistics: The mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range are calculated for each of the four features of the Iris dataset: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
- Visualization: The Iris dataset is visualized using scatter plots and histograms.
- Correlation analysis: The correlation coefficient is calculated between each pair of features in the Iris dataset.
- Principal component analysis (PCA): PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of the Iris dataset to two principal components.
- Classification: The Iris dataset is classified into three species (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica) using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier.

Iris Notebook

The following statistics are performed:

- Descriptive statistics: The mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range are calculated for each of the four features of the Iris dataset. This information can be used to understand the distribution of each feature.
- Visualization: The Iris dataset is visualized using scatter plots and histograms. Scatter plots can be used to identify relationships between pairs of features. Histograms can be used to visualize the distribution of each feature.
- Correlation analysis: The correlation coefficient is calculated between each pair of features in the Iris dataset. The correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables.
- Principal component analysis (PCA): PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of the Iris dataset to two principal components. PCA is a technique that can be used to identify the most important features in a dataset.
- Classification: The Iris dataset is classified into three species (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica) using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. SVM is a machine learning algorithm that can be used to classify data points into different categories.
  
The results of these statistics can be used to understand the characteristics of the Iris dataset and to develop machine learning models to classify Iris flowers.
